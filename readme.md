    OOP Concepts in PHP:
  
         Object-oriented programming: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming model that uses objects and their 
         interactions to design a computer programs.
     
         Objects: Objects are basic building blocks of a PHP OOP program. An object is a combination of data and methods. 
         In a OOP program, we create objects. These objects communicate together through methods. 
         Each object can receive messages, send messages, and process data.
     
         There are two steps in creating an object.
         
         Class : A class is a template for an object. It is a blueprint which describes the state and behavior that the objects of the class all share. 
         A class can be used to create many objects. 
         Objects created at runtime from a class are called instances of that particular class. 
         
         The basic programming concepts in OOP are:
             1. Abstraction: Abstraction is hiding the information or providing only necessary details to the client.
             2. Polymorphism: One name many forms.
             3. Encapsulation: Wraping up member variables and member functions together into a single unit(ie.Class);
             4. Inheritance: When a class acquire the property of another class is known as inheritance.
     
        Polymorphism can be achived by two ways:
          1. Method Overloading: Multiple methods with same name but different parameters in a class.
          2. Method Overriding: The parent and child classes has same method name.
